I also wonder...

With the rise of AI, ChatGPT, and advances in robots/ androids, General Artificial Intelligence (AGI), and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) may eliminate many jobs including yours (consultants are not excluded from the list). Of course, in previous industrial revolutions, more jobs were created with the advent of new technologies. I guess what we have to contend with as a society is the rate at which new technologies replace current jobs, how fast new jobs are created, and what is next for the human race. 

It becomes a question of whether will we become a post-scarcity society reaching toward utopian and egalitarian ideals, a corporate technocracy, or some disaster will wipe out the entire population on the planet. I always like how utopia is a play on words meaning ou-topos 'no place' or 'nowhere' and eu-topos means 'a good place'.

Will we ever rise above our petty tribalistic squabbles, ethnoracism and racism, hoarding of resources and wealth, and wage slavery (trading our time, one of the most valuable things we have, for money)? I would argue as human beings, as a civilization, that we can do better than this... 

I think we have bigger challenges to solve. Climate change and global poverty to say the least. Technology may be meaningless if we are roasting alive on a spinning rock through space. Even though technology helped get us in this predicament, it can also help us get out of it.

It seems that climate change, nuclear war, sustainable growth, and energy may be our next great filters, and barriers.

What do we want our legacy to be? A species that solved our most challenging problems, or one that dissipated because of fear and violence.

Ultimately, we are a small speck of sand, conscious for mere seconds, in the vastness of the universe. Our lives and the timescale of such are meaningless compared to the seemingly infinite universe.

From personal experience, I also know that Berkeley is not great at hiring managers; it is rare to have a good to great manager at Berkeley. My previous managers and managers of my colleagues have tended to be extremely self-serving, toxic, and myopic. I think this is due in part to bureaucracy and a system that rewards toxic managers at the expense of other's mental health. 

Let's have a real and honest conversation...

Tenured faculty are extremely powerful at the University. High-level administrators are also powerful. Fundraising managers are also powerful. Managers whether they want to admit it or not may have a career and financial incentive to suppress wages at any or all levels. Again, managers whether they want to admit it or not may have an incentive to pit employees against each other. Again, some managers may exhibit sociopathic, psychopathic, or anti-social traits, and are rewarded in the current system. 

Maybe the University should institute more stringent training for managers (and staff). Psychometric tests would be a good starting point.

Ultimately, we all know that staff have far less power than managers, until that balance is righted then this conversation is a moot point.

Although I joined the workforce in the 21st century, I have seen (prior to joining Cal) the legacy of workplaces where folks would stomp all over one another in order to make themselves look better, which I understand to be a more outdated approach to workplace environments. However, in my current unit, everyone seems to truly believe in working together toward a common goal, and no one treats their job as if it is their entire reason for living.

I have all of the skills and knowledge to complete the same tasks as those colleagues, but I struggle to feel accepted by them. That requires a huge lift among the leadership (of which I am part) to create a staff culture that normalizes a diversity of backgrounds and demonstrates each of the individual skillsets and perspectives that we each provide.

When I am bored, restless, frustrated, or needing a break, I reach for my phone to check social media and scroll quickly until something makes me laugh or think or smile. For a long time, I reached for twitter to scan the news throughout the day, especially if I was anxious about unfolding events but not so much any more. Now it's more of an empty habit that doesn't quite deliver what I need but I haven't yet managed to quit.","Most days I grab my phone before I get dressed to check the weather. If I forget my phone when I leave the house, I have to go back since I need it to log on to my devices at work. On my commute, I use wireless earbuds to listen to podcasts or audiobooks while I scan the news. I do not keep my bart card on my phone but my debit card is saved there in case I forget or misplace my actual card (which I tap at the register to buy coffee each day). At work I have a laptop and two monitors. I log in using my phone for duo security or a key fob device that I touch to log in. All day I am online checking email, gchatting colleagues, running query reports, attending zoom meetings (often with people in the same room also on zoom attending the same or different meetings). If it's too loud I use sound cancelling headphones so I can concentrate. During breaks, I text friends/family and scan social media for news or entertainment--sometimes I message people within these apps if something is funny enough to share. If it's someone's birthday, we use an app to order takeout and another app to pay the organizer for lunch and reimburse them for the amazon gift card we chipped in on as a gift. Throughout the day, an app on my phone tracks my steps and tells me how they compare to previous days or weeks. I use another app to track my diet to make sure I am meeting my health goals. Once a week I attend a class on zoom where the instructor encourages us to get up and stretch at the halfway point to take care of our health. On my commute home I listen to music or audiobooks and sometimes play games on my phone. At home, I often switch to a laptop to read longer news stories, email friends or family, or shop. If we are tired, we use an app to order dinner and another to stream the tv or movies we watch before we go to bed. I do not keep my phone in the bedroom but my husband does so he can use an app to track his sleep.","I have recently initiated a regular zoom call with my siblings to coordinate information and care for our aging mother. Every few weeks we zoom to discuss and between those calls we text and email each other updates, photos, questions, jokes, and complaints. We live far apart and can't get together in person more than once a year. The calls and texts allow us to have an ongoing conversation that would not have been possible without the current technology. ","Some months ago, my husband and I drove to the mountains to visit a friend for his birthday. It was February and snowing. Throughout the drive we were able to text my friend our whereabouts and the conditions we were driving through so he did not have to worry. He was able to guide us on the route and advise us about timing our departure to avoid the worst of the storm. ",I like to research recipes before I cook/bake a new recipe. I will often research different versions of the same dish and review all the comments before I begin.

I would ask about work expectations and goals and revisit that conversation over the course of a few weeks making sure I understood what they needed and wanted from the job. If the situation did not resolve in a few weeks/months I would raise the issue again with more emphasis on the needs and goals of the team and where the employee's behavior and expectations aligned and didn't align with the needs of the office.

Plus, our work is only becoming more complex, and in an institution as big and complicated as ours, it's impossible to build a bureaucratic infrastructure efficient enough to share information and context quickly. We need to rely on our relationships and trust to see campus-wide issues in their full context and understand the implications of our decisions.",an education professional,Jewish,a woman,"When you don't have a shorthand with someone, it takes a lot more work to interpret what they say and how they say it. When you're new to a job, you don't have a ton of context for your team and they don't have a ton of context for you, so I think there's a tendency to be particularly vigilant with each other until you have a sense of one another's sense of humor, priorities, values, etc. You're not 100% being yourself and neither is your team.","It goes a long way in my experience to just make sure to make time to check in personally before meetings and calls, see how they're doing, and give them some space to share whatever feels comfortable about their lives both professionally and outside of work. I also try to share a bit of myself and model that openness. ","I think many employees have a poor understanding of what their bosses and leaders do every day, and thus both judge them against a rubric that doesn't reflect what they're actually responsible for, and fail to leverage their leaders effectively. Understanding my manager, her priorities, her working styles, her stressors, has helped me to communicate effectively with her, understand what in my work she needs to know to do her job, and ask for things from her effectively. It also contributes to the functioning of our unit -- the more we as her employees are strategic about what needs to be on and off her plate, how to manage up, etc., the better she can advocate for our unit. I do also think it's easier to have a good personal rapport with someone when you can walk in their shoes a little bit and understand where they're coming from, which allows you to let differences in communication styles/working styles/etc roll off your back a bit better. When you don't have a good relationship or rapport, it's easy for neutral differences to snowball into bigger issues.",,,,,,,,,1,6,5,2,5,4,4,287,535,3,4,4,4,20,5,"I would want to address it with the employee. First, I would want to reflect and gather my thoughts on my perspective on the situation. Is there an actual performance issue, or does the employee just seem less enthusiastic and less happy at work? If a performance problem, I would want to make sure I have data or specific examples so I can explain what I am seeing and what I expect to see--eventually.

First, though, I would have a conversation with the employee about how things are going in general. What motivates them about their job, what's going well, what isn't, what they want to do more and less of, and how things have been going since I started. Depending on the employee's receptivity, I might mirror back at this point that I have noticed them seeming a bit disconnected, and open the door for more conversation about that, if there is anything they want to share, or need support with, but mostly I want to get a better sense of what the employee is feeling about their work.

From that conversation, I would have a better understanding of what's going on with the employee, and could make a plan from there to meet them where they're at.

I would not treat disengagement itself as a performance issue that needs to be managed. It's not required for an employee to be enthusiastic and go above and beyond all the time. If this employee is deprioritizing work but still achieving expectations, that's allowed and something I would support. But I do want to probe and understand if there's something in my control that would help them feel more connected at work.",1,"I would be willing to give them feedback about their work at any time, but unless their affect is actually harming their ability to get their work done, I wouldn't treat that as performance feedback.",5,4,4,4,"Even if it is the case that the manager just doesn't like me and isn't invested in me, falling back on that is ultimately not that helpful for me professionally or personally. So, I would challenge myself to assume neutral or good intentions and focus on bridging our communication gap as a problem-solving exercise. Some things I might try could be: making sure I have regular 1:1s with the manager, and making sure I am asking about how things are going for them and what they're working on. If I had a colleague I trusted, I might ask them for some feedback to see if they also notice what I'm noticing, that it doesn't seem like I'm connecting very well with the new manager, and if they have any reflections on what seems to resonate with this manager that I could try.

I don't think I would start the conversation with my manager with the big picture of feeling a little forgotten, at least not for a couple of months until they're a little more settled in and past the drinking-from-a-fire-hose stage. However, whenever I'm left off a meeting or similar, I would make sure to mention it, neutrally and non-judgmentally.

If after several weeks/months, this still seems to be the situation, I would use a scheduled check in to highlight my concerns, and ask what it looks like from the manager's perspective too. I would emphasize that I want to have a positive relationship, so if there are things that I can do differently, I am open to doing so.

The goal was to conduct a face-to-face interview where we can gauge the candidates interest and body language while answering our questions. The candidates also had an opportunity to see the diverse interview committee and see some of the people they would be working with.

If people start to make efforts to build positive relationships this helps highlight the bad habits and feelings that exist and can shine a light on things to be addressed, 30% is a critical mass, this is a significant number of individuals who seed others with the beginnings of positive workplace relationships.",a partner,a HR rep,a coworker,"There can be silos where the individual is not receiving feedback on their work efforts and may be at a distance from where operational issues are discussed. This isolation can created uncertainty, even if the individual is doing well and respected by others the lack of communication can cause the individual to question themselves. In addition some environments do not foster connections amongst peers, some workplace environments are competitive and interpersonal conflict is fostered by managers who tend to treat work as a competition and not a collaboration. An environment where employees feel that they have to fight for their position naturally creates distrust between individuals, even if they are not in direct conflict individuals want to appear as the ""best"" and sometimes this leads to them purposefully dsidelining others who they feel a threat to their position or putting down others as a way to increase their own preved statute within the organization. Even in smaller units where there is supposed to be close collaboration between two or more individuals the teams sometimes do not work if there is a belief of ""us against the world"" and if the team feels threatened it may work to oust or sideline their own members out of fear of them holding back their accomplishments. For example I witnessed an individual with a motor disability being ostracized and pulled off a lead position in a group project because their typing speed was seen as a indication that they were not qualified for the task, even though the task was analytical and not clerical in nature. The reasoning was that the individual would harm the perception of this group in the eyes of others harming the other members, even though this was not true. ","For me I have been both a manager and a line employee at the UC. For me I like to talk to individuals as a person and get to know them and let them know that I am a human and can be approached. In meetings I have found it important to look for individuals who want to contribute but who may be afraid of speaking up or tend to be talked over by others and ensure that they have a chance to contribute, this fosters an environment of empowerment and leads to more democratic decision making which increases buy in for projects. Also as mentioned previously there is a management school of thought that treats meaningless metrics such as typing speed as important to positions where it is clearly not important. Eliminating measurement that is unneeded and potentially leads to incorrect assumptions about productivity and can cause the individuals how may be the best actual contributors to the departments mission to be overlooked and devalued while accolades are given to those who work to the metrics and do not contribute as much to the actual mission. ","I have been both manager and employee at UC and the results of the first survey seem in line with my experience here. Employees often do not consider the feelings of their manager, sometimes the manager is seen as the face of the bureaucracy and an extension of a higher up power base which is in conflict with the needs and desires of employees. By talking to managers and having them be open about their job responsibilities and having them explain the motivations behind decisions a trustful relationship can start to grow. Often managers tend to not be as open as they can be to their employees, this creates mistrust and an adversarial relationship where employees often do not know why they are doing something and when that happens their engagement with the work is diminished. When a manager is able to speak frankly with their employees and be open about their feelings and opinions this creates a dialog where the employees feel a closer bond and relationship with the manager. The manager may be facing pressure from all around and getting conflicting instructions from above and this can translate to the work assigned to the employees, by being open to talking to the employees the manager may be able to find solutions to their own work problems and with that the employees feel that they have made contributions to the work as well, this collaborative approach to not only employee but managers problems can increase trust. ",,,,,,,,,1,7,3,3,4,5,4,412,496,4,3,5,5,21,4,"I have been through this exact situation at the UC when I was promoted to take over a work unit in a different area with a team that was new to me. I ended up talking to the individual on a regular basis, I involved them with the higher level work to increase their engagement. In the end we developed a good working relationship and the individual indicated that the reason for the drop in performance was that they were a candidate for the position and because they were already in that work unit they found it unfair that I was hired. Talking about this did not immediately heal the situation, but opened the door to where I could understand their point of view and work to help them to develop in their position so that they would be ready for the next opportunity that came along. In addition this individual was a great contributor and felt that their past managers had overlooked their work, by ensuring that good work was called out helped the individual to feel more appreciated and also lead to increases in productivity with the other team members as they could see that management cared. ",1,I have noticed that your work output has diminished and that you do not seem to be as engaged in the meetings as you have been in the past. I would like to understand what resources you may need to help with the work and to talk about expectations you may have of me and how I can better support you as an individual and as an valued member of our team. ,5,3,4,4,"Well this is not good management behavior, especially if I was the only one receiving that kind of treatment. I understand that the individual may be new and overwhelmed but it is easy to feel put off if you are not included. What I have done in the past it to make the effort to try to get to know the person, if they have better rapport with others it may be the efforts of the others, and not the manager, that created the rapport and if I reach out this may open the window for my relationship with the manager to improve. Also talking to the manager about the meetings would help, it could be that there is a critical item that has an urgent deadline outside of my area that needs attention or it could be because the manager does not clearly understand my role in the organization and doesn't know to include me, I improve this by reaching out and offering assistance.

2) Tell me about a difficult situation you faced at work and explain how you managed the situation- This is a common question that helps to shed light on the individual's ability to handle situations, however we need to be aware that the applicant may feel uncomfortable explaining a situation that involves things like interpersonal issues and discrimination they tacked in the workplace so they may not be open to share. 
3) Tell me about any experience you have working with duties similar to the ones this job requires, include all relevant experience including as a, individual, student, volunteer and or employee - This helps to determine where their experience level is at, there is a need to recognize that relevant experience is not always gained through the workplace but can be found in other aspects of life such as their duties as a volunteer, at home, at school and in the workplace.

Also there is a level of nervousness from new managers so they seek to control the workplace to ensure that they look good in the new position, however they tend to harm the workers that are actually doing the work, since they do not understand the work they tend to overreact on small errors which are visible but not take the right actions on the larger, more important things that are not always as visible upfront but have great impacts to work, usually down the line.
